###Chapter 1
I remember the first time I traveled in time. It was so long ago. I was 20 back then. I was walking from Starbucks to the Empire State Building. I was going there for my interview for my job, and I knew that I wasn't prepared at all because I didn't know how to prepare. The job description stated that an organizer of files was needed. He needed to be athletic, quick, and be able to fit into tight spaces. It seemed a little strange, but the promised pay was good, so I applied. I approached the Empire State Building, went inside, and went through the x-ray machine. I then took the elevator up to the 34th floor, found the office, and told the secretary about my appointment. She pointed me toward an unmarked, black door. It opened, and a man dressed in a tuxedo, wearing sunglasses, and black pants greeted me. Inside the room there were two white chairs, a stark contrast against the black walls, floor and ceiling. The chairs seemed to be the only source of light in the room, as they were glowing slightly. The man in the tuxedo introduced himself as Mr. Ogotrati. He then proceeded to ask me a question that startled me slighty.

"How good are you at solving puzzles?"

"Relatively good," I replied after flashing Mr. Ogotrati an inquisitive look. He then took out a piece of paper, and a pen. On the piece of paper was a maze. He told me to go from the letter S to the letter F. It took me a few seconds, but I managed. Mr. Ogotrati frowned slightly. He flipped over the piece of paper. There was a Sudoku puzzle. He told me to solve it. After about 4 minutes, I solved it. His facial expression didn't change. He took out a second piece of paper, on which there was a historical crossword on one side, and a 'decode the message' on the other. Mr. Ogotrati looked at me, and smiled slightly. It was obvious that the smile was a forced smile, and it only increased my nervousness.

"Organize these index cards by alphabetical order," he said, pulling out a pack of index cards with various names, words, sentences, and paragraphs from his tuxedo. I quickly shuffled through them and re-arranged them. It took me approximately 1.5 minutes.

"Good," he said. He then proceeded to stare at me. Tension in the room was rising, and I had a feeling that I was about to be fired. Suddenly, he clapped his hands twice, and the door opened.

"Welcome to the team," said Mr. Ogotrati. He then picked up a black cube off of the floor. I had not noticed this cube earlier because it was a black cube, on a black floor. He gave it to me. It was approximately one inch tall, and it was split in half. Instinctively I turned the cube to see what would happen. It turned a quarter of a turn to the left and snapped into place. There was about half-a-second pause, and then I then felt as if I was being dragged backwards, and then as if I was falling backwards. All noise vanished and all that I could see was the color blue. Different shades of blue surrounded me, and seemingly became me. Then, as if waking up suddenly from a dream, I found myself on top of a tree. My eyesight seemed to have improved greatly from that because I could see a few meters away the date of a newspaper. It was 1963.

###Chapter 2
The man trudged through the snow with nothing but a bottle of something, some clothes, a coat, and some sort of blue orb. The snow plowed at him relentlessly, not showing any sign of giving up. In all directions, only snow was visible.
