title: Betacism
---

In historical linguistics, betacism is a sound change in which `b` (the voiced bilabial plosive, like in bane) shifts to `v` (the voiced labiodental fricative, like in English vane). Betacism is a fairly common phenomenon; it has taken place in Greek, Hebrew, and Spanish, among others.
